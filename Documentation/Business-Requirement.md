## Business Requirements: European Housing Market Dashboard

**Objective:** Develop a Power BI dashboard enabling strategic analysis of European housing markets through three core lenses:

1. **Market Overview**  
   *"What are the current macroeconomic housing trends across European regions?"*  
   Track median prices, price-to-income ratios, and year-over-year changes across countries to identify high-growth markets and affordability crises.

2. **Sales Performance Benchmarking**  
   *"How do sales velocity and transaction volumes compare between key markets?"*  
   Analyze days-on-market trends, sales volume seasonality, and regional transaction efficiency to optimize portfolio timing.

3. **House Type Economics**  
   *"Which property types yield the highest ROI in different demographic regions?"*  
   Compare price premiums, liquidity, and appreciation rates for apartments vs. houses across urban/rural divides and city tiers.
